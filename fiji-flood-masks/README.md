# Fiji Flood Masks

10 m spatial resolution flood masks associated with two Tropical Cyclone Events (TC Yasa in 2020 and TC Cody in 2022) have been generated. The flood masks were generated by applying a threshold to a ratio of pre- and post-event Sentinel-1 SAR data following a method presented by [UN-SPIDER](https://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-google-earth-engine-flood-mapping/step-by-step) and an implementation from [Gandhi (2021)](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/gee-water-resources-management.html).

Flood masks have been generated for Tropical Cyclone Events where there was sufficient cloud-free optical images to verify that the Sentinel-1 flood masks correspond to actual flooding. 

The Google Earth Engine scripts used to generate the flood masks and visually verify flooding are included in this repository.
